        <p>The pharmaceutical industry is one of the most dynamic sectors of the economy. This industry releases several new drugs into the market every year, and this makes it necessary to impart training on the features of these new products to their sales people. This can be done easily using the online training medium. E-learning facilitates effective training of the sales representatives of pharmaceutical firms without disrupting their work as online courses can be accessed anytime, anywhere. These courses can be updated very easily and rapidly, and this considerably reduces the time-gap between the launch of the medicine and training to the sales staff.</p>
