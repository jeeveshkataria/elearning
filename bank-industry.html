        <p>It is well-known that the Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) sector plays a key role in the economy. Banking and financial organizations are in the continuous need to train their employees on new processes, financial instruments, technologies, and so on. E-learning is an effective solution to the various training challenges (such as process, software, financial instruments, sales and so on) faced by banking and financial professionals. It also helps the employees of these firms to equip themselves with the skills and knowledge required to use the complex software proficiently and communicate first-rate information-security training.</p>
