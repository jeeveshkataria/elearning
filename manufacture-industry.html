        <p>The manufacturing industry is one of the major and important segments of the economy and U.S manufacturing industries are estimated to manufacture products worth about $1.8 trillion every year. These organizations need to train their employees on various aspects such as the code of conduct, anti-bribery policies, information security, safety, Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) and so on.</p>
        <p>Let us look at an example screen on GMP regulations from one of our courses. GMP regulations require manufacturers of food and pharmaceutical products to produce the products according to prescribed quality standards. It covers all aspects such as production, hygienic premises and equipment. If GMP regulations are violated, it results in serious consequences (such as fines and even imprisonment, company seizure, and recall of batches of products). With such e-learning courses, industries can train their employees effectively to prevent violation of GMP regulations. After all, prevention is better than cure!</p>
